{\bf Building Bayesian Influence Ontologies}
\\This project, which is currently in progess under supervision by Dr. Ritesh Ajoodha, aims to develop a method by which the influence between interacting models can be modeled as a Bayesian network and learned from data using score-based structure learning techniques. Example applications include plagiarism detection and detecting influence between musical pieces.\\
