\begin{rSection}{Projects}
{\bf Building Bayesian Influence Ontologies}
\\This project, which is currently in progess under supervision by Dr. Ritesh Ajoodha, aims to develop a method by which the influence between interacting models can be modeled as a Bayesian network and learned from data using score-based structure learning techniques. Example applications include plagiarism detection and detecting influence between musical pieces.\\
{\bf Wits Moodle Marker Extension}
\\ \url{https://github.com/theWronskians/moodle_dev}
\\This project extended the existing moodle plugin used by Wits to automatically mark code submissions. It was extended to incorporate more feedback, integrate with multiple marking servers and better handle the marking of Matlab code.\\
